      This my copy of Skyrim for the Xbox 360. I spent hours playing this game when I was younger, and always find myself coming back to it to start a new game. It's defintely my favorite video game of all time.

      My childhood best friend went away to go to school at the University of Florida once we graduated highschool. Since we missed eachother, we both bought eachother lanyards with our school mascots on them. It's been 5 years I still use them as my set of keys!

      This was my cat Mimi's collar! She was the first cat I ever had - I took her in after she started living in the bushes on my property. Unfortunately she passed away earlier this year, so her collar is how I remember her (and pictures of course).
