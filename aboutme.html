      But you can call me Lilly! I'm 23 years old and a graduate student at Pratt Institute. I currently work as a marketing intern in a speech therapy office, mostly making stickers and assisting them with their website redesign. In the future I hope to transiton to working in video game development.

         I have a few hobbies, but I've been really into watching movies lately. I've made the conscious decision to put my phone down when watching recently, and have found that I get much more from the experience. I also love reading! My favorite books are Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn and Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger.

      Since Covid, I've put a lot of effort into making my room a representation of myself and what I enjoy. This is reflected through my decor and other trinkets like the ones I've included on this website. I've aimed to make my room a place I enjoy spending time in!
